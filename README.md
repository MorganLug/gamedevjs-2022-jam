# gamedevjs-2022-jam

## What is this project about ?

Our first submission in a game jam !
Game that was made for the April 2022 Gamedev.js jam. In case it doesn't work in itch.io, you can play the game here : https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedev-recycle-game

Theme was Raw : We got the idea to go with a game about recycling. Recycling is the process to extract raw materials from used and transformed objects.

The game is simple : You are presented with multiple objects and a sequence of actions to make in order to recycle them. You have 30 seconds to recycle as many object as you can.

The game mechanics are simple but allowed us to put into practice in a project what we learned about Unity. You can find the submission here : https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2022/rate/1501566
